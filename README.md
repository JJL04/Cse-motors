# CSE Motors â€” Assignment 1

This is a small Express/EJS project scaffold for the CSE Motors home view assignment.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\lukej\httpsgithub.comJJL04Cse-motors\Cse-motors
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site.

Notes:
- Replace the placeholder images in `public/images` with the course-provided images if available.
- The site uses server-side validation for the contact form and stores inquiries in `data/entries.json`.
- A `Procfile` is included for deployment to Render.com.
